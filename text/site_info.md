North Carolina Highway 12 (NC12) is the gateway to the Outer Banks, a chain of low-lying barrier islands. This roadway can flood both during storms and high tides. Access to NC12 is so important, it has its own Twitter: <a href = "https://twitter.com/NCDOT_NC12" class = "pretty-link">@NCDOT_NC12</a>. 

Here, we use public webcam imagery of NC12 from <a href = "https://drivenc.gov" class = "pretty-link">DriveNC.gov</a> to train a machine learning model -- the NC12 FloodCamML -- to identify street flooding in real-time. We have trained the model using 1,200 images, **but you can help make it smarter**.
